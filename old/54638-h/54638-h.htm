<p class='c008'>“<span class='sc'>Now</span>, mamma, I have finished
my work: is it well done?” said little
Julia, as she showed the pocket-handkerchief
she had just hemmed to
her mother. Her mother replied,
“Yes, my love, very well done:
fold it neatly up, put it into my
work-bag, and then go to play.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> May I go into the garden?
The sun is in the west, but he is not
set. Look, mamma, how beautiful
the sky is! The clouds are like gold!
And see, the fields and trees, a great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>way off, are of a beautiful purple
colour; while the elm trees here, on
this side of the garden, look almost
yellow, because the sun shines on
them. Mamma, may I go to the
bottom of the lane, behind the elm
trees? I shall have time to go there
before the sun is quite gone.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Vincent.</span> Why, Julia, do you
wish to go there?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> Because the bank, near the
end of the lane, is covered with
primroses, and violets, and cowslips.
You know, mamma, Mary, my dear
Mary, will come home to-morrow.
Now I should like to pick a great
many flowers, and put them into her
room, to look pretty and to smell
sweet. Mary is fond of primroses,
violets, and cowslips. May I go,
mamma? I will not be gone long: I
will run very fast all the way there,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>and all the way back. May I go,
mamma?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Mrs. V.</span> Yes, my dear, you may:
you may stay out half an hour—not
longer.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> Oh, thank you, mamma!
Half an hour is very long: I shall
come in sooner than that. I am
sure I shall not stay out so long, so
very long, as half an hour.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Mrs. V.</span> I do not desire you to
come in sooner; but if you do not
take care, you will, perhaps, stay
beyond the time I have mentioned.
Half an hour will pass very quickly,
whilst you are busy gathering your
nosegay.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> I believe you are right,
mamma; for I never know when it
is an hour, or when it is half an
hour. When I am doing any thing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>that is disagreeable, the time seems
so long; but when I am talking with
you, or doing any thing that is very
agreeable, an hour seems like a minute.
How shall I know when to
come in? Can you tell me, mamma?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Mrs. V.</span> It is now half past six
o’clock; when the church clock
strikes seven, come in.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> Oh, yes! thank you, mamma.
I can hear the church clock
strike very well, from the place
where the primroses grow; and I
can listen all the time I am gathering
the flowers.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Mrs. V.</span> Well, put on your hat;
make haste. If you go on chattering
here, the half hour will be over
before you get to the bank.</p>

<p class='c009'>Julia put on her hat, her tippet
and her gloves, and ran as fast as she
could down the lane. When she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>reached the spot where the flowers
grew, she was tired and out of
breath. She sat on the bank, for a
few minutes, to recover her breath:
she was soon rested. Then she jumped
up, and began to look about her.
She looked round for the largest and
freshest flowers, as she wished to
have a beautiful bow-pot. She had
only gathered three primroses, a few
violets, and had her hand on a fine
wild hyacinth, to pluck it, when she
heard a rustling noise behind her:
she looked to see what occasioned
it. As she turned her head, something
large, white, and heavy, fell
over the hedge, from the field on
the other side, rolled down the bank,
and lay quite still. Julia wondered
what it could be. At first she thought
it was a large stone; but she did not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>see or hear any person who could
have rolled it over the hedge; and
stones cannot move by themselves.
She stood looking towards the place
where the white thing lay, unable to
decide what it was. In a few moments
she heard the faint bleat of a
lamb. Now she guessed it was a
poor lamb, which had been frightened.
She supposed that, in its haste
to get away from the cause of its
terror, it had fallen down the high
bank into the lane. She feared it
was much hurt; for it cried, as if it
was in pain, and did not attempt to
move. She went up close to it: it
lay quite still: she patted its back—it
bleated piteously—it tried to lick
her hand. She was surprised to find
it so gentle, till she observed a blue
ribbon about its neck: then she
thought it was Miss Beauchamp’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>pet-lamb. She had been told that
Miss Beauchamp had a favourite
lamb, which was so tame that it fed
out of her hand. She recollected,
likewise, that the field next the lane
belonged to Sir Henry Beauchamp;
that his house was very near, a few
yards to the right. She therefore
felt quite sure it was Miss Beauchamp’s
lamb. Julia was sorry the
poor animal was hurt: she wished
somebody would come and take it
home; but she feared, that if she
ran to tell the people at Sir Harry
Beauchamp’s to fetch it, the church-clock
would strike seven before she
had finished gathering her bow-pot.
She turned to go back to the flowers.
The poor lamb bleated again,
very piteously, and seemed, to implore
her to have compassion for its
sufferings. Julia stopped: she said,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>“Mary is kind and humane: she
would not leave any animal in distress,
without trying to assist it.
Besides, when I read, to-day, how
God made the world and all things in
it, mamma told me he was good and
merciful; that he loved all the creatures
he had made: she said too, we
ought to endeavour to imitate him,
that he may love us.—No; God will
not love me, if I am cruel to this
poor little lamb. Well, I will go
and tell somebody at the house
where it is. Perhaps, after all, I
shall have time to get a small bow-pot.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Away Julia ran; but in a moment
she heard the barking of a dog: she
saw the lamb make an effort to rise
and run away; but it could not
stand, it fell down directly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Poor little lamb!” said Julia,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>“how terrified it is: no doubt that is
the dog which hunted it. If I go
away, the cruel dog may find it, and
worry it to death, before any person
can come to its assistance. Oh! I
see the dog running across the field
yonder. What can I do? I will try
to carry the lamb home: it is only a
little way to Sir Henry Beauchamp’s
house.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Julia returned to the lamb, and
after two or three endeavours, succeeded
in getting it up into her little
arms. It was very heavy: it was
as much as she could carry. When it
bleated, she said, “Do not cry,
pretty little lamb: I try not to hurt
you; but you are very heavy, and if
I do not hold you tight, you will fall
to the ground. I am carrying you
home, where you will be taken care
of. I will make haste: I will walk
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>as fast as I can—but you are very
heavy.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i015.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p><i>“I will walk as fast as I can—but<br />you are very heavy.”</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The lamb could not understand
what the little girl said; however, it
was accustomed to be petted and
caressed, therefore her kindness and
fondling soothed and pleased the
poor animal. It lay quietly in her
arms: it neither kicked nor struggled
to get away.</p>

<p class='c009'>Julia walked as fast as she could;
yet she got on very slowly, for she
was soon tired; so tired, that she
would have sat down to have rested,
had she not feared the dog might
jump from the field into the lane, and
follow her. Besides, if she did not
make haste, there was no chance of
her having time to gather the primroses
before seven o’clock. She went
on, therefore, only stopping a moment,
now and then, to recover
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>breath. At length she reached the end
of the lane. She turned to the right;
but before she had gone as far as
the gate that opened into Sir Henry
Beauchamp’s park, she saw several
people come through it, and come
towards her. A little girl ran on
before the rest of the group: when
she was near Julia, she exclaimed,
“It is my lamb! The moment I saw
you, I knew you! Dear, naughty
lamb, why did you run away from
me?—Thank you for bringing him
to me. You look very tired. Give
him to me now, if you please: I
will carry him to his own house.”—“Take
care,” replied Julia, “how
you hold it; for it is badly hurt, I
fear. It is not a naughty lamb, I
believe. I think it has been hunted
by a dog. I was gathering flowers
in the lane, when it fell over the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>hedge: its leg is cut so badly, that
it cannot stand. See, how it bleeds!
I was coming to tell you or somebody
to fetch it; only I saw a dog
at a distance, and I feared he would
bite it, if I came away, so I have
brought it with me. I made haste,
lest the dog should overtake us, if he
got into the lane. See, he has found
us out! Look, he is running towards
us!—I am glad the lamb is safe. No,
no, dog; you cannot get the lamb
now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>By the time Julia had finished
speaking, Sir Henry and Lady Beauchamp,
with two servants, who were
all in search of the lamb, came up
to her. “See, mamma,” said Miss
Beauchamp, “this kind little girl
has brought my lamb home. He is
very much hurt. Poor Bello! you
are very heavy: I can hardly hold
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>you.  Mamma, there is the dog
which frightened Bello!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Lady Beauchamp desired one of
the servants to carry the lamb into
the house, and the other to find out
to whom the dog belonged, and to
tell his master to keep him at home,
that he might not do any more mischief.</p>

<p class='c009'>Sir Henry Beauchamp returned
to the house, to examine the poor
lamb’s leg, and to see what could be
done for it. Miss Beauchamp went
likewise, to assist in nursing her
favourite.</p>

<p class='c009'>Lady Beauchamp took Julia by the
hand, and said, “I am much obliged
to you, my dear, for all the trouble
you have taken. Come with me, and
eat some strawberries and milk, to
cool and refresh yourself: you appear
fatigued and heated.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> Thank you, ma’am; I
should like to rest myself, for I am
tired; but I do not think mamma
would be pleased, if I went with you
without her permission; and she
only gave me leave to go into the
lane to pick flowers. Besides, I am
to go into the house again at seven
o’clock; and I wish very much indeed
to get some primroses and
violets, to ornament Mary’s room
against to-morrow.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Lady B.</span> You are right, my dear,
not to do any thing your mamma
would disapprove. What is your
name, my love? Where does your
mamma live? I should like so good
a child to come and play with my
little girl. If I ask your mamma,
perhaps she will allow you to
come, some evening, and drink tea
with us. I do not think you would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>dislike strawberries and milk for
supper, if your mamma approved
it. Should you?</p>

<p class='c009'>Julia, smiling, answered, “Oh, no,
ma’am! I like strawberries very
much. I used to eat them, last summer;
but I did not know there were
any ripe now: we have none in our
garden. The strawberry-plants are
only in blossom.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Lady B.</span> I have none ripe in the
garden. Those I shall give you will
come out of a hot-house. Where do
you live, my dear? What is your
name?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> My name is Julia Vincent,
ma’am: mamma lives at the top of
the lane.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Lady B.</span> At the pretty white cottage,
which stands in a garden? I
recollect it. Mrs. Vincent has not
lived there long, I think?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> No, ma’am; only a little
while. We lived in London before.
I do not like London. Mary will
come down to-morrow, for the first
time. I forget, I shall not be able
to gather the flowers for her, if I do
not make haste. Good bye, ma’am.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Lady B.</span> Who is Mary?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> My sister. She is very
good. I try to be like her. I hope
I may be as good and as wise as
Mary, when I am as old. Mamma
came here because London made
her ill. She brought me with her,
but Mary staid with my aunt. To-morrow
they will both come here.
Then I shall be happy; for I love
Mary, she is so kind to me. Mary
likes primroses, cowslips, and violets.
She will be pleased to see her
room so pretty: she will not expect
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>to find so many flowers blown, for
there are none in London.</p>

<p class='c009'>As Julia ended her speech, the
church-clock began to strike: she
added, in a melancholy tone, “So,
it is seven! I must go in: Mary
will have no flowers.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Lady B.</span> I am sorry, my love,
your kindness to Bello has been the
cause of this disappointment to you.</p>

<p class='c009'>Julia added, more cheerfully—“Perhaps
I shall have time to-morrow
to get some, before she comes.
It is my own fault: if I had gone
back directly, I should have been
able to have gathered a few. I have
lost the time chattering. If I chatter
any more, mamma will wonder
where I am. Good evening. I hope
the lamb will soon be well.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Julia ran home. Her mother was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>surprised to see her return empty-handed.
“Where are your flowers,
Julia?” asked Mrs. Vincent: “I
expected to have seen a bow-pot
almost as big as yourself.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> Oh, mamma! just as I was
beginning to gather it, a poor lamb
fell over the hedge. It was so badly
hurt, that it could not walk—it
could not stand. It was very tame,
and had a collar of blue ribbon
round its neck. So I guessed it belonged
to the young lady who lives
at the large house in the park. You
know, mamma, Mrs. Thomson, who
called to see you yesterday, talked
a great deal about Miss Beauchamp,
and her pet-lamb, which fed out of
her hand.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Mrs. V.</span> Yes, I remember she did.
Now tell me what became of the
lamb.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> Mamma, I carried it home:—no,
not quite home; because I met
Miss Beauchamp, and her papa and
mamma, before I reached the gate.
The lamb was very heavy: I could
not walk fast whilst I had it in my
arms. By the time the servant took
it from me, and that I had talked a
little, the church-clock struck seven,
and I was obliged to come in without
the flowers. I am very sorry—very
sorry, indeed; because Mary
will come home to-morrow.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Mrs. V.</span> Very sorry, for what,
Julia? because the lamb is hurt?
because you have no flowers? or
because Mary will come home to-morrow?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> Oh, no, mamma, not that.
I am glad my dear Mary will come
home to-morrow. I am sorry I have
no flowers to put into her room. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>wished, so very much, to ornament
her room with flowers, to surprise
her, that though I was sorry to see
the lamb in pain, and bleeding, do
you know, mamma, I was near leaving
it where it was, and gathering
the bow-pot, instead of carrying it
to Miss Beauchamp.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Mrs. V.</span> What determined you,
my dear, to assist the lamb?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> Why first, mamma, I thought
it was not like Mary, to leave it in
its distress. Then I remembered, she
would know nothing about the matter,
so I fixed to gather the primroses;
but just as I settled so to do,
I recollected that you told me, this
morning, that God was merciful and
kind to all things, and that we
ought to endeavour to resemble
Him: I mean, to resemble Him as
much as we can. You know, mamma,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>if we try and try for ever, we
shall never be as good as God is. I
was afraid God would be displeased
if I were cruel to the poor lamb.
Now, though Mary would not know
I had been naughty, I was sure God
would, as he sees and knows all that
is done in the world. Did I think
rightly, mamma?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Mrs. V.</span> You did, my dear.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> Are you glad, mamma?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Mrs. V.</span> I am; I am always glad
when you are good. I am pleased
you remember what you read, and
what you are taught. I rejoice too,
to find that you make a proper use
of the knowledge you possess. It
is of no use to know that God sees
and hears us at all times, if we do
not take care to act in a manner that
is pleasing to him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Vincent then kissed her little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>daughter, and patted her rosy cheek,
Julia stood by her mother’s side a
few minutes, without speaking, and
then said,</p>

<p class='c009'>“After all, my being good was of
no use, mamma?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Mrs. V.</span> How so? I do not understand
you, Julia.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> Do not you recollect,
mamma, I told you, Sir Henry and
Lady Beauchamp, and two servants,
as well as Miss Beauchamp, were all
come out to look for the lamb.
They would have turned up the
lane where the lamb was; so that if
I had gathered my bow-pot, Bello
(that is the name of the lamb)
would have been taken care of, just
the same. It would have been the
same thing—no, not the same thing,
for I should have had the flowers
for Mary.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span><span class='sc'>Mrs. V.</span> Stop, Julia; let us consider
a little before you proceed.
Perhaps it would not have been the
same thing to the lamb; certainly it
would not have been so to you.
First, it is possible Sir Henry and
Lady Beauchamp might not have
turned up the lane where the lamb
was; they might have walked straight
on. Supposing, after they had looked
in other places, they had, at last,
found the poor animal, the length
of time it might have lain without
assistance, would have added greatly
to its sufferings. The other day,
when you fell off the stile, cut your
hand, and beat the gravel into the
wound, I fancy it would not have
been the same thing to you, whether
I had attended to it or not? If,
instead of returning directly to the
house, soaking your hand in warm
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>water, cleaning it from the stones
and dirt, and putting sticking plaster
over it to keep the air from it, I had
first finished my walk and had left
your hand bleeding, with the gravel
sticking in it, for an hour or two,
you would have suffered a great
deal more pain.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> Yes, mamma, indeed I
should. My hand smarted sadly,
and hurt me extremely at first; but
after you had dressed it, and tied it
up so neatly, it was soon easy. We
had a charming walk afterwards. I
am sure I should not have enjoyed
the walk, or any thing else, whilst
the pain continued. Pain is very
disagreeable. Well, if I saved the
lamb some misery, I am glad;
though by doing so, I have lost the
flowers. I do not think Mary would
have admired them when she found
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>out that I had left Bello in order to
gather them. Every time she looked
at them, she would have thought
more of the poor animal, than of
their pretty colours or sweet smell.
Every time she spoke to me, I
should have feared she had discovered
the truth. When she said, “thank
you, dear Julia, for these flowers,
I like them very much,” I should
have thought, You would not love
me, if you knew all. I should not
be your dear Julia, if you knew I
had been cruel and unkind to a
dumb animal, on purpose to get
this bow-pot. So, after all, mamma,
it is well I did not gather the flowers:
they would not have made me
happy. Mamma, you said, just now,
that certainly it would not have
been the same thing to me, if I had
left the lamb. Why not, mamma?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span><span class='sc'>Mrs. V.</span> Goose-cap! why ask
that silly question? Reflect on what
you have yourself said, and find out
the reason if you can.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> Oh, now I guess, mamma!
Because, though the lamb might
have been taken care of, I should
not have had any merit: I should
have been cruel all the same, though
chance might have brought some
one else to its assistance.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Mrs. V.</span> True, my dear; you
would have been conscious of having
acted improperly.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> Mamma, if I get up early
to-morrow morning, may I go and
gather the primroses, violets, and
cowslips, before breakfast?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Mrs. V.</span> You may; I am glad this
idea has occurred to you. I hope
you will still enjoy the pleasure of
ornamenting Mary’s room.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> Why do you say <i>hope</i>,
mamma? I am now sure of the
flowers, as you have given me permission
to gather them.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Mrs. V.</span> You considered yourself
sure of them, this evening, when
you left me; yet, Julia, you were
disappointed. No one is sure of the
future. It is possible, something we
do not at present foresee may again
disappoint you.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> I do not think so: Miss
Beauchamp has no more pet-lambs
to fall over the hedge.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Mrs. V.</span> Are Miss Beauchamp’s
pet-lambs the only things in the
world? Suppose it should rain to-morrow
morning, I should not then
allow you to go out in the wet: I
should fear you would catch cold,
and be ill, as you were in the winter.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> Do you think it will rain,
mamma?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Mrs. V.</span> No, Julia; I do not expect
a rainy day to-morrow. The
appearance of the evening promises
a fine morning. I do not think you
will be again disappointed: I hope
not. I only said, it was possible
you might not be able to accomplish
your wishes.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> Oh dear! If I am disappointed
again, what shall I do,
mamma?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Mrs. V.</span> Bear the trial well, my
love. If you should not have all
you wish for, you will still have a
great deal to make you happy. Do
not look sorrowfully, Julia. You
are not disappointed yet. It will be
time enough for that dismal face,
when the evil is come. It is wise to
resolve to behave well when we are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>tried: it is silly to fret about misfortunes
which may never happen.
You told me you talked a little—to
whom?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> To Lady Beauchamp.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Mrs. V.</span> What did she say to
you? What did you say to her?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> She thanked me for carrying
the lamb home: she asked me
to go with her, to eat strawberries
and milk.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Mrs. V.</span> Did you go?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> No, mamma. Might I have
gone? I thought you would not
approve of my going, without your
knowing where I was.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Mrs. V.</span> You judged correctly.
I should not have confidence in you,
if, when I permitted you to go to
one place, you went to another,
without my knowledge. I should
not then trust you out of my sight.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> I am glad you have confidence
in me: but, mamma, do you
know, Lady Beauchamp said she
would ask you to give me leave to
spend an evening with her little
girl. Shall you permit me to go,
mamma?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Mrs. V.</span> I cannot decide now, my
dear: when Lady Beauchamp fixes
a time for your visit, I shall be able
to judge whether it will be convenient
and proper for you to accept
the invitation or not.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> I hope it will be convenient
and proper. I dare say I
should be very happy, and spend
the evening very agreeably. Do
not you think so, mamma?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Mrs. V.</span> Yes, most probably you
would.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> Mamma, did you know
strawberries were ripe?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span><span class='sc'>Mrs. V.</span> It is too early for them
in the open air. Those that are ripe
at this season of the year, must be
forced.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> Yes, Lady Beauchamp said
they grew in—in some house.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Mrs. V.</span> In a hot-house.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> Yes, yes, in a hot-house;
that is what she said. What is meant
by a hot-house, mamma?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Mrs. V.</span> A house built on purpose
to hold plants. The top and
sides are made of glass, in frames,
something like windows, which shut
tight to keep out the cold air. At
one end there is a stove for a fire,
to heat the air within the house.
Round the walls are flues, to let the
heat from the fire reach every part.
Flues are passages left in the inside
of the walls: they are somewhat like
pipes. When the frames are shut,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>no cold air can get into the house
from the outside, so the gardener
can keep the plants as warm as he
chooses. The flowers and fruit blow
and ripen in a hot-house, as they do
in the gardens in summer. This is
called forcing them; that is, making
them more forward than they would
naturally be at this season. When
you go to see Lady Beauchamp,
perhaps she will allow you to look
at her hot-house; then you will understand
better what I have said.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> Thank you, mamma; I believe
I understand you. But why is
so much glass used? If it be necessary
to keep a hot-house very warm,
I think brick walls would answer
better than glass: bricks are thicker
than glass.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Mrs. V.</span> True, they are so; yet
glass excludes the air as perfectly as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>a brick wall does. The frames are
made to open and shut like windows;
and this circumstance enables
the gardener to let in fresh air when
proper. Brick walls could not be
moved about at his pleasure. Besides,
glass admits the light: it is
transparent. Flowers and trees require
light, in order to make them
grow, as well as air. They would
never come to perfection if they
were shut up in darkness.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> How strange, mamma!
They could grow as well in the
dark, I think: they do not want
light to show them how to grow.
Why will they not grow in the
dark?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Mrs. V.</span> I cannot tell why, Julia;
but that plants require light to make
them thrive, is a fact which has been
proved by many experiments. When
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>you are old enough to read natural
history, you will find many other
curious things. The world is full
of wonders. The works of God are
extremely curious and wonderful.
The more you see and hear of them,
my dear, the more cause you will
discover to love the Almighty for his
mercy and goodness, and to adore
and admire his infinite wisdom and
power.—Now, my dear little girl,
kiss me, and go to bed: it is past
eight o’clock.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> Good night, my dear mamma.
I shall get up very early to-morrow
morning. If it be fine, I
may gather the flowers before breakfast,
without waiting to ask you:
may I not, mamma?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Mrs. V.</span> You may. Good night,
my love!</p>

<p class='c009'>As soon as Julia awoke, the next
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>morning, she recollected the bow-pot.
She jumped up and washed and
dressed herself. Though Julia was
a little girl, not quite seven years
old, she could dress herself. Her
mother did not wish her to be helpless,
and had therefore taught her
to do many things for herself, that
some children, of her age, are obliged
to have done for them. The
little gown she wore in the morning
fastened in the front, therefore
she could button it without assistance.
She was glad her clothes were
made in a way that enabled her to
put them on without help. If she
could not have dressed herself, she
would have been forced to have
staid in bed till the servant had been
at leisure to attend to her. She
made haste to get ready, said her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>prayers attentively and devoutly,
and then ran off merrily. Her mother
had taught her that it was right
to pray to God repeatedly; and she
was too good ever to forget this
important duty. She never allowed
her pleasure, or her business, to
make her forget her prayers. Every
night, before she lay down, she entreated
God to forgive all her faults,
and thanked him for the blessings
she had enjoyed. Every morning,
before she left her room, she returned
him thanks for the refreshing
sleep she had had, and prayed him
to watch over her, and enable her to
do what was pleasing in his sight.</p>

<p class='c009'>When she reached the bank, she
was sadly disappointed: all the finest
flowers were gone: only a few faded
ones were left, which were hardly
worth the trouble of gathering.—“Oh
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>dear, what a pity!” said poor
Julia, “I wonder who has been
here! I wish I had got up earlier.
However, perhaps it was last night
that they were plucked. I saw some
boys and girls at a distance, as I
went home: probably they came
this way and took the primroses. I
wish they had not touched them. I
dare say they did not want them as
much as I do: but I will pick some
of these, and ask mamma if she thinks
Mary will like them. I fear she will
not, for they look half dead!”—The
disconsolate Julia walked slowly
back, with the faded nosegay in her
hand. She met her mother, who
was coming down to breakfast, in
the passage.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> Oh, mamma! you were
right in saying we could not be sure
of the future. I have lost my bow-pot,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>notwithstanding it is a fine
morning: all the good flowers are
gone! See, mamma, only these
shabby things were left. Did you
think, last night, somebody would
take them before I went to gather
them?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Mrs. V.</span> No, Julia, I did not: I
am very sorry for this second disappointment;
particularly as you bear
it with good humour, and do not
indulge in fretful repinings. These
flowers, in their present faded state,
would be no ornament to your sister’s
room. But I believe I can assist you
in your distress. On Monday, when we
walked through the lane on the other
side of the church-yard, I observed
a profusion of wild flowers in the
hedges; and in the fields adjoining
there are primroses and cowslips.
It is too far for you to go alone; but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>after breakfast I will accompany you
there. I hope that, after all, you
will have the bow-pot you are so
desirous of. You have conducted
yourself very well, my love, both
last night and this morning. Yesterday
you gave up your own pleasure
to assist the poor lamb; and now
you support the loss of the flowers
with good temper. I am glad it is
in my power to make you some
amends.</p>

<p class='c009'>Whilst at breakfast, Julia expressed
her fears that Mary might arrive
before she returned from her walk.
“At what o’clock, mamma, will my
aunt and Mary be here?” said she.
“I cannot tell exactly,” replied
Mrs Vincent. “Not so early, however,
as you seem to expect. London
is more than twenty miles from
this village. Your aunt will, I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>believe, set off soon after her breakfast;
but we can walk to the church-lane,
and back again, in a shorter
time than she can travel twenty
miles. I expect you will be able to
do a great deal of business before
they arrive. I think you will have
time to ornament Mary’s room, say
your lessons, and work, all before
they come. I do not suppose they
will be here till nearly three o’clock.”
“Not till three o’clock!” exclaimed
the little girl: “that is a long
time.”—“It will not appear long, if
you employ yourself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>When breakfast was finished, Mrs.
Vincent put on her hat and cloak,
to walk with her little daughter.
Julia fetched her clogs, and just as
she was tying them on her mother’s
feet, she heard some one knock at
the hall-door. “Oh, mamma, I do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>believe they are come! I am so
glad!“ She was so delighted at
the thoughts of seeing her sister,
that she did not, even at that moment,
recollect the bow-pot. ”May
I open the door to let them in,
mamma?“ said Julia.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Mrs. V.</span> You may open the door,
Julia, though I do not imagine it
will be to let Mary in: it is much
too early.</p>

<p class='c009'>Julia opened the door, but instead
of Mary, she saw Miss Beauchamp,
holding a large bow-pot, and
a servant, who was with her, carrying
a beautiful rose-tree, in full
bloom, in her arms. Julia exclaimed,
in raptures, “What lovely
flowers!”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Miss B.</span> I am glad you admire
them. They are yours. Mamma
sends them to you, with her love.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>All these hot-house flowers mamma
sends you; but these primroses, violets,
cowslips, and blue-bells, I give
you. Mamma gave me permission
to get up very early this morning,
to gather them for you. I did not
know the gardener had been desired
to bring in a nosegay, so I arose
very, very early, and gathered all
these. I do not mean I picked them
every one myself: no, Charlotte,
who went with me, helped me. Do
you know, whilst I was at breakfast,
this bow-pot was brought into the
room. Mamma put it into my
hands, and said, “Emily, you may
carry these flowers, with my love,
to your little friend, who kindly
took care of Bello last night.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i048.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p><i>The Bow-pot &amp; Rose Tree.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Julia was lost in admiration: she
nearly forgot to thank Miss Beauchamp.
She took the flowers to her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>mother, and asked if she had ever
before seen any so extremely beautiful:
“Pray smell them; they are
very fragrant.” Then she turned to
Miss Beauchamp, and said, “I thank
you, very much: pray tell your
mamma, I am very much obliged to
her. I am sure Mary will be surprised:
she will never expect to see
such beauties? Is the lamb well,
to-day? How is its poor leg? Does
it bleed still?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Miss B.</span> No, it does not bleed
now. Papa dressed it last night, and
he thinks it will soon heal: it is
getting well; but it is still sore.
Poor Bello cannot skip about the
lawn, as he used to do. I nurse him,
and bring him fresh grass and flowers
to eat, as he cannot go in search of
them himself. I hope he will soon
be strong again. Will you come
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>and see him? Mamma told me
she should be happy to see you,
whenever it is convenient to Mrs.
Vincent to spare you. Bello will
soon know you, if you play with
him. He will eat out of your hand. I
dare say he will be fond of you:—he
ought to be so, you were so kind
to him last night.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> I shall like, very much, to
feed him and play with him.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Miss B.</span> Will you, ma’am, allow
Miss Vincent to come and spend this
evening with me, or to-morrow
evening? Mamma said, any evening
that was agreeable to you. I
hope it will be convenient to you
to permit her to come soon.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Mrs. V.</span> Julia, my dear, what are
your own wishes?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> Thank you, mamma; not
this evening, I shall have so many,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>many things to tell Mary, and to
hear from her.—If you will give me
leave to go to-morrow, I shall be
very happy.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Mrs. V.</span> I will trouble you then,
my dear, to return Lady Beauchamp
my thanks for her kindness to my
little girl, who will be happy to accept
her ladyship’s invitation for to-morrow
evening.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Miss B.</span> Good morning, ma’am.
Mamma told me not to stay long,
lest I should be troublesome. Good
bye. Pray come early to-morrow
evening: I have a great many pretty
things to show you, that I think you
will like very much.</p>

<p class='c009'>On turning to go out she saw
the rose-tree, and returning, added,
“I had forgotten the rose-tree. I
brought it to help ornament your
sister’s room. See, there are several
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>buds on it, besides the full-blown
roses. If you take care to water it,
and give it fresh air, it will continue
blowing a long time. It is my own
tree, so I may give it to you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Julia was delighted with her presents.
She knew not how to express
sufficiently her thanks. She
repeated, “thank you, thank you,”
many times. She smelled the nosegay
again and again.—She jumped
and danced in ecstacy.—She exclaimed,
“Mary will be quite astonished!
I wonder what she will say! My
dear Miss Beauchamp, I am greatly
obliged to you. I will take care of
the rose-tree, after all the roses are
gone. I shall always love it, because
you have given it to me. I
never thought, last night, when I
went to gather some primroses, that
I should enjoy all this pleasure.—Pray
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>do not forget to tell your
mamma, I thank her very, very
much indeed. How good she is!—Kiss
the lamb for me, and give him
my love: I hope he will be very
well by to-morrow evening.—I dare
say we shall be very happy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As soon as Miss Beauchamp was
gone, Julia begged she might put
the flowers into water immediately,
before they began to droop. Her
mother was kind enough to lend her
a large flower-pot and two small
ones, and to offer her assistance in
arranging her treasure, that the various
colours might appear to the
greatest advantage.—“Dear mamma,
that water is still warm, I am sure!”
exclaimed Julia, in amazement, on
observing her fill the large flower-pot
out of the urn which was standing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>on the table: “though it is a
long time since the urn was brought
up for breakfast, I do not think the
water can be quite cold yet.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Mrs. V.</span> Neither do I wish that it
should be quite cold, Julia.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> You are not going to put
the flowers into warm water, mamma!
I always put mine in cold water.
I never remember your putting
any into warm water before!</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Mrs. V.</span> Probably not, my dear:
you never have been accustomed to
flowers out of a hot-house. Hot-house
flowers live longer after they
are gathered, if they are put into
water with the chill off. They have
been reared in the warmth, and the
sudden change from heat to cold is
not good for them.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> How shall we manage,
mamma, to keep the water warm?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>I shall forget, perhaps, to add a little
now and then; and what you have
put in, will become cold soon. How
shall we keep it warm?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Mrs. V.</span> It is not necessary it
should continue warm: it will cool
gradually, and the flowers will, by
degrees, be familiarized to the temperature
of the water, as well as of
the room—that is, familiarized to
the heat of the air which is in the
room. The degree of heat or cold of
any thing, is called its temperature.</p>

<p class='c009'>Julia carefully untied the bass,
which was wound round the stalks
in order to hold them together.
She displayed the whole of her treasure
on the table, and consulted
with her mother, to determine what
flowers would go best together, and
how to form the prettiest groups.—“Only
smell this rose!—Look at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>this sprig of myrtle! See how delicate
this lilac is! These lilies of
the valley are quite lovely!—Did
you ever see a brighter yellow,
mamma, than this jonquil! Look at
this hyacinth—and this—and this!
I do not know which is the finest.
Which do you admire most? the
white, the pink, or the blue? I will
place your favourite in the centre—here,
just in front. That does very
well. But, mamma, do not you
think it will be better to have a
little more green? Shall I put these
geranium leaves here, at the back?—Oh,
thank you! that does beautifully!—There,
that flower-pot is
full.—I wish I could draw. I dare
say Mary will copy some of these
beauties: I will ask Mary to teach
me how to copy flowers.—Well, now
we may begin to fill another flower-pot.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>In this manner did little Julia
chatter on, as busy as a bee, till this
important affair was finished. Then
she assisted in carrying the flower-pots
and rose-tree into the small parlour,
which was set apart for Mary’s
room. It was a pretty, cheerful
room: the window opened into the
garden. The prospect of the country
beyond was rich and fertile. The
inside was fitted up with shelves, on
which Julia had ranged all her sister’s
books. There were likewise
drawers for work, &amp;c. and convenient
places for writing and drawing
implements, as well as maps of different
kinds. It was in this room
that Julia expected to spend many
delightful hours. She could amuse
herself quietly, without disturbing
her sister when she was engaged;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>and therefore she was often allowed
to remain the greatest part of the
morning with her. She was very
attentive, and desirous of learning;
and therefore her sister willingly instructed
her, and, when at leisure,
was in the habit of reading and conversing
a great deal with her; teaching
her geography and other useful
things, which afforded her much
amusement. The two small flower-pots
were placed on the chimney-piece,
by Julia’s direction: the large
one stood on a high green basket.
The rose-tree was placed on a small
table, opposite the door, that Mary
might see it the moment she entered
the apartment.—Julia went out and
came in again, that she might judge
of the effect on first opening the
door.—“Do, mamma, be so good as
to come here. Will not Mary be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>delighted?—will she not be astonished?”
she repeatedly asked.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Mrs. V.</span> Yes, Julia; I expect this
grand display will surprise her. You
will wish to enjoy the pleasure of
showing her the house, particularly
this room, yourself; therefore I advise
you to begin your lessons, that
you may be at leisure when she arrives.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> It is early yet, mamma.
There is no hurry. I need not walk
to the church lane now, you know,
mamma.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Mrs. V.</span> Very true; yet, admiring
these flowers, and settling them and
the room to your satisfaction, has
taken up more time than the walk
would have done. It is now past
twelve.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> Past twelve!—I should
think you are mistaken, mamma.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>Mrs. Vincent showed her watch.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> So it is—five minutes past
twelve!—I could not have believed
I had been more than two hours with
the flowers. Well, mamma, I will
run and fetch my books: they shall
be ready by the time you get back
into the breakfast-room. You shall
see I will be very good and attentive.“</p>

<p class='c009'>Julia was very attentive: she did
all her lessons well; she wrote a
copy; cast up two sums in addition,
without a single error; read a little
French, and did some grammar.—When
the grammar was finished, she
sat down to work. She asked her
mother if she might talk to her
while she was hemming her handkerchief.
Her mother said she might.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> Pray, mamma, why do you
not have a hot-house, as well as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>Lady Beauchamp? It would be very
agreeable to have flowers and fruits
at this season of the year, when there
are none in the open air. Do not
you think so, mamma?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Mrs. V.</span> Yes, certainly, it would
be agreeable.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> Then why do not you have
one?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Mrs. V.</span> Because I am too poor.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> Oh! now, mamma, you
seem to be joking: you are not
poor—not very poor.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Mrs. V.</span> I did not say I was very
poor; but still, I am too poor to have
a hot-house, with propriety. Hot-houses
are extremely expensive: the
glass costs a great deal of money to
keep it in repair; for it is so brittle
that it is frequently broken. Coals
are likewise very expensive; and the
constant fires which are necessary to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>bring the fruits and flowers forward,
during winter, consume a great
quantity. Then the wages of the
gardeners would be very high. All
these things would be more than I
could afford.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> But still, mamma, I do not
think you poor. I call Mrs. Jones,
who lives in the cottage at the end
of the lane, poor.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Mrs. V.</span> No, certainly, I am not
as poor as Mrs. Jones is: she and her
husband are obliged to work hard, to
earn enough to buy coarse food and
clothes for themselves and children.
When the poor man was ill, in the
winter, and could not labour, the
family were almost starved. Do not
you recollect, Mrs. Jones told me her
husband would have died, and herself
and children would have perished
through want, if Sir Henry and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>Lady Beauchamp had not sent
medicines to Jones, when he was so
ill with the rheumatic fever, good
warm flannel to clothe him, meat to
make him broth, and plenty of potatoes
and rice, for the children
to eat, till he was well enough to
earn his wages again? Sir Henry
Beauchamp and his lady are also
kind to a great many other poor
people, and assist them when they
are ill and unable to work. They
are very rich, and are therefore able
to do all this good, and at the same
time have hot-houses and other expensive
things.—I could not.—If I
were to attempt to have a hot-house,
I should have no money to pay the
butcher and the baker for bread and
meat. Besides, it is not right to spend
all we have on ourselves: we should
always take care to save some of our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>money, to give to those who are in
distress, and who are still poorer than
ourselves.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> I am sorry you are not very
rich, mamma!</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Mrs. V.</span> Why, Julia?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> It would be so pleasant to
have money enough for every thing.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Mrs. V.</span> My dear little girl, if we
do not learn to be contented with
what we have, we shall never be
happy. Even Sir Henry and Lady
Beauchamp, whom at present you
consider the richest people in the
world, would not be happy if they
encouraged a discontented disposition.
No one, my dear Julia, has
every wish gratified; but each person
has reason to be grateful to God
for many blessings. Jones and his
family, though poor and miserable,
have great reason to be thankful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>that their rich neighbours are so
kind and attentive to them. Reflect,
my dear child, how many blessings
<i>you</i> enjoy. You have all that is necessary,
and even much more—you
have many pleasures that thousands
of others cannot obtain.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> Yes, mamma; yet, do not
you think I should be a little happier
if I had flowers all the year round?
I am sure the flowers this morning,
have made me very happy.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Mrs. V.</span> These flowers are a novelty
to you; that is the reason you
admire them so extremely. Hot-house
flowers do not afford Miss
Beauchamp, who is accustomed to
them, more pleasure than common
roses give you, in the midst of summer:
and, last summer, how often
you passed a rose-tree without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>bestowing a thought on it. To-morrow
night it will be the same—you
will be delighted with many things
which she disregards. But is all the
happiness you feel on the present
occasion, produced by the beauty of
the nosegay? Try and discover, if
you can, some other source of delight.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> I believe one reason that I
am so gay and merry, is, because I
expect Mary will be pleased and
surprised.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Mrs. V.</span> Yes, my dear, I am sure
the thought of giving Mary pleasure
makes you happy. But reflect
again. Perhaps the cause of Lady
Beauchamp’s kindness has some
share in your happiness.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> Oh, mamma! I guess what
you mean—about the lamb.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Mrs. V.</span> True, Julia. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>consciousness of having done a humane
action, is always pleasing. If you
had lost your bow-pot entirely, you
would still have had the comfort of
reflecting that you had acted properly.
Recollect, we settled last
night, that you were happier without
the flowers than you would have
been with them.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Julia.</span> So we did, mamma; but I
am glad I have this beautiful nosegay,
as I did not get it by cruelty.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Mrs. V.</span> So am I, my love: I rejoice
that your compassion has been rewarded.
You must not, however,
expect it will always be the case.
Many humane and benevolent actions
are not recompensed in this
world. We must endeavour to do
our duty, without thinking whether
the immediate consequences will be
agreeable or not. Though we may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>sometimes lose a pleasure, we shall
enjoy the happiness of possessing
the approbation of God, and of our
own conscience.</p>

<p class='c009'>Little Julia thanked her mother
for having talked so much to her,
and said she hoped she should always
be good, that God might love
her. She had now finished her work,
and her mother desired her to fetch
her book to read. She did as she was
bid to do, immediately, sat down,
and read the following story.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<h3 class='c011'>THE RED-POLE.</h3>

<p class='c008'>A little girl, whose name was
Emma, was anxious to have a bird;
but her mamma refused to give her
one, as she disapproved of confining
the pretty little creatures in cages.—“Mamma,”
said Emma, one morning,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>“I know a great many little girls
who have birds.” “Very probably,”
replied her mother: “it is not
uncommon to keep them in cages;
but that circumstance does not make
it less wrong. When you are older,
if you do what other people do,
without considering, you will often
do wrong. You must think for
yourself. If you were to catch one
of those happy little birds, which
are flying about from tree to tree,
and hopping from branch to branch,
chirping so gaily and singing so
sweetly, you would render it miserable.”
“Indeed, mamma,” interrupted
Emma; “I have seen canary
birds, goldfinches, and many other
kinds, which are very cheerful, and
seem to enjoy themselves very contentedly.”
“But,” said her mother,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>“they do not pass their lives in the
same degree of enjoyment, as if they
were flying about.”</p>

<p class='c009'>A few days after this conversation,
Emma’s cousin came to spend a few
days with his aunt, before he returned
to school. He had a very pretty
bird called a Red-pole: he had reared
it from the nest. It was very tame.
He had taught it many tricks: it
would eat out of his hand, and stand
perched on his finger whilst he walked
about the house. Emma was extremely
fond of it, and wished, more
than ever, that her mamma did not
think it improper for her to have a
bird. She spent much time, every
day, with her favourite: it grew fond
of her quickly, and appeared to
know her as well as it did its master.
The day before her cousin went to
school, Emma entered her mother’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>dressing-room with the red-pole on
her finger. “Mamma,” said Emma,
fixing her eyes anxiously on her mother’s
face, “Cousin Edward says, he
must not take red-pole back to school
with him. Dr. Barton desired him not.
He said it took up too much of his
time and thoughts. So he told me,
just now, that he was glad red-pole
loved me, and that he would give it
to me. Poor red-pole, it is of no use
your loving me, I fear! I may not
keep you.—I suppose you must fly
away!”—“No, Emma,” answered her
mother; “we must do the best that
we can for it now. The poor creature
has been rendered so helpless, that
it would perish from want: you may
therefore keep it. Remember, however,
you undertake a great charge.
Children are little to be trusted: they
frequently neglect their pets. Many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>unfortunate favourites perish, from
the carelessness of their thoughtless
masters and mistresses. Let me see
that, in this instance, you will act
wisely and humanely.” “Oh!” cried
Emma, eagerly, “I never shall forget
my dear little red-pole! Thank you,
mamma.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Emma did, indeed, pay attention
to her bird for the first week. At
length she grew tired of seeing the
same tricks over and over, without
the smallest variety. She was constantly
trying to teach it something
new. Unfortunately, one day it occurred
to her, that it would be entertaining
to see how it would behave
in the water. Emma forgot it
was winter, and that the weather was
very cold. She determined to try
the experiment. She chirped, and
held put her finger. Poor red-pole,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>as usual, hopped on it. She carried
him to a pitcher of water, which
unluckily was in the room, and
plunged him, head foremost, into it.
The bird struggled violently. Emma
took him out. How great was her
horror to see blood gushing from
his beak and eyes. He writhed, kicked
in agony, and in a few moments
expired.</p>

<p class='c009'>Emma burst into tears. “Oh,
mamma,” exclaimed she to her mother,
who at that instant entered the
chamber, “I have killed my bird!
You are right—children are not to be
trusted! I never will have another
bird! Oh my poor red-pole! my
dear red-pole, which I loved so tenderly!”</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c009'>Julia talked with her mother some
time about the tale she had just read.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>When she had finished her observations
on Emma’s conduct, she put
the book on the proper shelf in
Mary’s room. She returned to her
mother, and as she passed the window
she saw a carriage drive to the
door of the house. “They are come!
they are come!” cried the happy
Julia, jumping and clapping her
hands, in ecstacy: “how fortunate,
mamma, I have finished all my business!”—As
soon as the joy and bustle
of the meeting were a little over,
Mrs. Vincent smiled and said, “Now,
Julia, you may show your sister the
different apartments of the house.
Your aunt and I will follow. Lead
the way.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Julia took her sister by the hand,
and led her, in silence, through the
passage.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mary, this is to be your sitting-room,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>cried the little girl, as she
threw open the door of the important
room.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My room!” exclaimed Mary:
“how beautiful!—it is full of flowers!
Dear mamma, how good of
you to ornament my room with
these lovely flowers.—A rose-tree
too, in full bloom.—These are hot-house
flowers. Have you a hot-house,
mamma.” “No, my dear, I
have not,” replied Mrs. Vincent;
“nor are you indebted to me for
these rare and lovely flowers: they
were all given, this morning, to
Julia.”—“They are yours now, my
dear Mary,” interrupted Julia; “I
give them to you.”—Mary kissed
her sister, and added, “I thank you
very much, my love, for so beautiful
a present. But I am curious to learn
whence you had them.” Julia
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>coloured, threw her arms round Mary’s
neck, and whispered, “Lady Beauchamp
gave them to me.” Mrs. Vincent
smiled and said, “I permitted
Julia the pleasure of introducing you
to your apartment—she merited that
gratification; but I shall not allow
any one to rob me of the happiness
of relating to you the story attached
to these flowers. You, my dear
Mary, who have assisted me in instructing
our little Julia, have a right
to share the delight her behaviour
has afforded me.”—Mary’s curiosity
was strongly excited, and her mother
immediately related to her the
whole transaction about the lamb.</p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
